Implementation of an Online Electronics Store
Project: Online Electronics Store

Definition:
An Online Electronics Store is a backend-driven application built using Java and JDBC to manage products, orders, and user data effectively. This platform focuses on providing functionality for adding products, managing inventory, creating orders, and tracking purchase histories.

The core backend logic allows users to browse available products, add items to their cart, and place orders. Store administrators can update product details, monitor inventory levels, and process customer orders.

By utilizing Java and JDBC, the system ensures reliable database connectivity and efficient data management. This project is designed to handle the essential operations of an online store while delivering a robust and scalable backend infrastructure.

•  Object-Oriented Programming:
The project heavily relies on the principles of OOP such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to create reusable and modular code.
•  Database (PostgreSQL):
Creating our database and schemas(tables)
Language Features Used:
Lambda Expressions: To simplify code and improve readability.
Interfaces: were used to define contracts for the service and repository layers, promoting flexibility and testability.
Abstract classes provided base implementations where necessary.
